                        The Valorant system requirements mean that your new FPS obsession can run on practically any PC
                        still running today. Hell, I reckon there are pocket calculators out there that could run the
                        new
                        character-based tactical shooter from League of Legends devs, Riot.
                        Formerly named Project A, the new 5v5 competitive shootout finally has an official title, a
                        vague
                        Summer 2020 release date, and a set of PC specs that mean pretty much anyone with an interest in
                        PC
                        gaming will be able to jump on board the Valorant bandwagon and get shooting when the servers go
                        live this year. That means gamers right across the globe will be battling it out for top
                        Valorant
                        honours.
                        The game consumes 15gb of space from the disk.

                        The Valorant minimum PC specs are so damned minimal that if your machine wasn’t powerful enough
                        to run it I reckon you’d have difficulty even loading up this ‘ere webpage. The Intel i3 370M it
                        references is an ancient laptop CPU from ten years ago. TEN YEARS AGO. It’s practically a
                        fossil. It also doesn’t have the graphics silicon to match the other minimum specs so if you did
                        have an i3 370M laptop it probably still wouldn’t run Valorant, though an i3 notebook from the
                        last seven years would…

                        <b>Graphics cards</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The Valorant minimum spec GPU for 30fps is noted as Intel HD 3000 silicon; that’s the GPU
                        component of the Sandy Bridge CPUs from 2011. It was only the top Sandy Bridge chips that had
                        the HD 3000 GPU, however, but any mobile processor from 2013 onwards should probably do the job.

                        <b>Processor</b>
                        <br><br>
                        If you want to hit 60fps in Valorant then you’re going to need to go for a desktop i3 processor.
                        From about six years ago. The recommended Intel Core i3 4150 is a dual-core, four-thread CPU
                        with a clock speed of 3.5GHz. Basically anything that can match that and you’re golden.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Graphics cards</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The 60fps recommended spec calls for an Nvidia GT730 graphics card, a GPU from around six years
                        ago. It’s actually more expensive to try and bag one of those new, but the modern equivalent,
                        the GT 1030 will see you right. The AMD equivalent would be the RX 550, and that should actually
                        perform better.

                        <b>Processor</b>
                        <br><br>
                        If you’re aiming for the magic 144fps mark then you’re going to need a quad-core, four-thread
                        CPU of the Intel Core i5 variety for Valorant’s high-end system requirements. Which is still
                        pretty damned minimal considering modern i3s are now quad-core chips with higher clock speeds.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Graphics cards</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Riot recommends the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti as the go-to card for Valorant’s high-end PC specs. If
                        you’re a dyed-in-the-wool GeForce gamer then stick with that or the GTX 1650 if it’s around the
                        same price when you look, but if you’re not fussed on the brand the excellent AMD RX 570 will be
                        faster.
