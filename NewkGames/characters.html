                <p>
                    There are 12 Valorant characters in the game at the time of writing and it’s likely that there are a
                    few more in the works. We’ve played them all since the game released to the public and have a pretty
                    good idea of all the character abilities in Valorant and what kinds of role they each excel at
                    across the battlefields of this tense tactical shooter.
