                    Agents have different variations of weapons, typically firearms, to cater to specific playstyles or
                    metas. Weapons are separated by two categories, Sidearms and Primary weapons. Sidearms consists of
                    handguns used for close-quarters. Primaries include SMGs and Shotguns that are used for
                    close-quarters, Sniper rifles for long range, and Rifles and Machine guns to accommodate for both
                    close and long range.
                    Weapons can be purchased by Agents using creds during the pre-round sequence. Each Agent is equipped
                    with a Knife and the Classic sidearm for free by default. Agents will keep the weapons they purchase
                    through each round until they die. Weapons can also be picked up off the ground from deceased
                    players, both friendly and hostile, which will carry on with the player into the next round.
