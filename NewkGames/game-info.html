                    Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for
                    Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a
                    closed
                    beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020
                    Blend your style and experience on a global, competitive stage. You have 13 rounds to attack and
                    defend
                    your side using sharp gunplay and tactical abilities. And, with one life per-round, you'll need to
                    think
                    faster than your opponent if you want to survive. Take on foes across Competitive and Unranked modes
                    as
                    well as Deathmatch and Spike Rush.
